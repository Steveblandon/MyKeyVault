# MyKeyVault
Small program I created to mess around with encryption for storing passwords and account information. The program by no means follows any encryption standards of cryptography as far I know. What it actually does is that the program obfuscates data in a text file, then a separate file is created as the key that the program needs to decrypt the data file. The main idea being that you put this key file in a separate physical device like a USB. The program can be set to automatically check a USB drive for the key file as soon as it starts.
